  title={Game Theoretic Approaches in Ensemble Learning},
  author={Iyer, Sethu},
  year={2017},
  type={Master's Thesis},
  institution={BITS-Pilani},
  abstract={This thesis explores the application of game theoretic methods in Ensemble Learning, specifically focusing on Banzhaf Power Index and Borda count methods for classifier importance evaluation and prediction aggregation. The research introduces novel techniques for feature selection using conditional mutual information and ensemble pruning through Banzhaf Random Forests.},
